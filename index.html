                    Great spaces and accommodations for 2 adults and 2 young"</p>

                    <p>"Wow - what a wonderful home on a peaceful pond! This is absolutely one of the cleanest properties I have stayed in! I love the simple yet tasteful decor and the light and bright interior.</p>
                    <p> Communication from the host was clear, concise, and friendly. The pond wildlife are a joy to wake up to (even if they wake up early!) and we enjoyed watching the fish swim around the dock. It was a busy trip visiting family but we hope to stay at this property again and enjoy some of the outdoor amenities more!</p>
                    <p> We enjoyed a couple of meals at close by McSwiggan's Pub. Great food and service!</p>
                    <p>Highly recommend this property if you need to stay at a convenient South Shore location!!"</p>

                        <p>This is a peaceful home with a pretty pond view that is especially lovely in the morning.
                            We slept very well here. I appreciated Phuong's flexibility with our check in time. You might be able to find a home even more surrounded by nature (i.e. with trails, forest, ocean) elsewhere on the south shore but this home strikes a nice balance of still providing a great view while being conveniently located to the highway and stores.</p>
